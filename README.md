## Notice
I went from $12/mo to $7/mo and managing almost no infrastructure when moving from AWS EC2 to Heroku. The custom domain required moving from Free to Hobby (hence the $7).

I'm using [Preact](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli), which is a fun lightweight version of react that's almost identical in DSL.

## CLI Commands

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# test the production build locally
npm run serve

# run tests with jest and preact-render-spy 
npm run test
```


## Deploy to Heroku
```bash
git push heroku master

heroku open
```
